## AI-Powered Content Moderation Software

A modern, real-time content moderation platform powered by TensorFlow.js and advanced AI models to help protect online communities from harmful content.

### Purpose and Vision

This open source project aims to create a scalable, AI-powered content moderation software that can be integrated into various social media platforms and online communities. By offering an API, this software will enable platforms to seamlessly moderate text (and potentially image) content to ensure a safer environment for users. The long-term goal is to develop a robust, versatile solution that can be adopted by social media apps and other online platforms requiring effective content moderation.

In the future, this software API could serve as a comprehensive moderation backbone for various apps, handling moderation tasks across diverse platforms and helping developers maintain community standards. This vision allows the project to expand beyond individual applications, providing a reliable, adaptable, and scalable content moderation service.

### Features
